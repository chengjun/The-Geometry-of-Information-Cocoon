This code is for paper The Geometry of Information Cocoon: Analyzing the Cultural Space with Word Embedding Models on https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10083.


We construct the cultural space with word embedding models among three large-scale datasets of digital media use. Our analysis reveal that information cocoons widely exist in the daily use of digital media across mobile apps, mobile reading and computer use. Moreover, people of lower social class have a higher probability of being stuck in the information cocoon filled with the content of entertainment. In contrast, the people of higher social class have more capability to stride over the constraints of information cocoon.


For protecting the privacy of users, the behavior datasets are only avaliable through collaborative research.
